# Geomatric Dynamical Systems analysis

This package contains a data-driven method to analyse transitions and state-space evolution of dynamical systems.

## Getting started

We recommend you install the code on a fresh Anaconda virtual environment or create a Docker image. The code is built in [PyG (PyTorch Geometric)](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html), which needs to be preinstalled. We recommend you do this via Pip (and not Conda).

Then clone this repository, 

```
git clone https://github.com/agosztolai/GeoDySys
```

Finally, install by running inside the main folder

```
pip install -e . 
```

## Examples

The folder `/examples` contains some example scripts.
