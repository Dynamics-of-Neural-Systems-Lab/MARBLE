# MARBLE - **Ma**nifold **R**epresentation **B**asis **L**earning

This package contains a geometric deep learning method to intrincally represent vector and scalar fields over manifolds and compare representations obtained from different vector fields. The examples  

The code is built around [PyG (PyTorch Geometric)](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).\

## Installation

We recommend you install the code on a fresh Anaconda virtual environment, as follows.

First, clone this repository, 

```
git clone https://github.com/agosztolai/GeoDySys
```

Then, create an new anaconda environment using the provided environment file that matches your system.

For Linux machines with CUDA: 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

For Mac without CUDA:

```
conda env create -f environment_cpu_osx.yml
```


This will install all the requires dependencies. Finally, install by running inside the main folder

```
pip install . 
```
